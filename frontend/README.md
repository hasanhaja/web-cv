The only official ReScript starter template.

## Features

- PWA
- PWA should be installable and all the data must be cached. Explore if some of the machine learning could occur client side. This could be a very simple model, but the server side can be more fluent. This usage data should still be collected and cached and sent to the server when connected.
- Static (at first)
- Dynamic in the second phase
